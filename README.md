Lung Cancer Prediction Model
This repository contains a logistic regression machine learning model developed to predict the likelihood of lung cancer for individuals based on their past medical histories and current conditions.

Overview
This model utilizes logistic regression, a popular statistical method, to analyze the relationship between various medical features and the probability of lung cancer occurrence. By training on a dataset containing historical medical records and corresponding cancer diagnoses, the model learns to classify individuals into high or low-risk categories for lung cancer.

Features
Logistic Regression: Implemented using Python's scikit-learn library.
Dataset: Utilizes a comprehensive dataset of past medical histories and lung cancer diagnoses.
Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning and  feature selection.
Evaluation: Assesses model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure predictive performance.
Usage
Data Preparation: Ensure your dataset is properly formatted and contains relevant medical features.
Training: Run the provided Python script to train the logistic regression model on your dataset.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict lung cancer probabilities for new patient data.
