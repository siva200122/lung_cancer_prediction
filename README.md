Lung Cancer Prediction Model

This repository hosts a logistic regression model designed to predict lung cancer likelihood. It considers gender, smoking history, yellow fingers, and various medical symptoms. By analyzing past medical data and current conditions, the model offers accurate predictions. Gender inclusion aids in assessing diverse risk profiles, while smoking history and yellow fingers serve as vital indicators of tobacco-related risks. Incorporating a broad spectrum of medical symptoms enhances precision in risk assessment. This model represents a significant advancement in early detection and personalized healthcare interventions. Its insights hold promise for improving patient outcomes and advancing precision medicine.

Problem description:
This will help health care seeks to gain insights into the factors that impact the lung cancer prediction in the people. The key objectives:
1. Develop a predictive model using past medical records for early cancer detection in new patients.
2. Offer personalized interventions and education to encourage healthier habits and early detection.

Goal:
The ultimate goal of this project is to employ advanced predictive analytics techniques, such as logistic regression machine learning, to develop a robust model for accurately identifying individuals at high risk of developing lung cancer. By leveraging demographic data, medical histories, and current health conditions, this model aims to provide early detection and personalized risk assessments. 

The overarching objective is to implement targeted interventions and educational initiatives that empower individuals to adopt healthier behaviors, leading to a reduction in lung cancer incidence and mortality rates through proactive healthcare management.

Logistic Regression: Implemented using Python's scikit-learn library.

Dataset: Utilizes a comprehensive dataset of past medical histories and lung cancer diagnoses.

Prediction: Use the trained model to predict lung cancer probabilities for new patient data.
